Parts of this code were adapted from https://github.com/devression/hangman-game-js with modifications to fit the requirements of this project.
This is a browser-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. Players guess the hidden word by selecting letters, one at a time, before the stick figure is fully drawn. The game includes three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
